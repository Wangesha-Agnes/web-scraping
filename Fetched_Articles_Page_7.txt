The Busia border crossing is the main land checkpoint for goods and travellers passing between Kenya and Uganda. The facilities were upgraded in recent years to make it a one-stop border crossing between Busia, Kenya and Busia, Uganda. A vehicle and container scanner are one of the new installations that has hastened the processing time at Busia border points making a total of 500 trucks per day through all agencies. The town of Busia (Kenya) is the capital of Busia County and lies on the direct route between Kampala and Nairobi via Kisumu. Many travellers take a direct bus between the 2 capital cities, which takes 12-13 hours. Individuals crossing the Kenyan-Uganda border are required to have certain documents to do so, including the following: Passport (or national ID for East Africans). Visa (if applicable). Yellow fever vaccination certificate. Nationals of East African Community (EAC) member states do not need a visa to enter Kenya or Uganda and may also enter using a national ID card in place of their passport. International visitors who meet the Kenyan eVisa requirements can take the convenient option of applying for their visa online, which skips any unnecessary trips to an embassy. Some of the bottlenecks at the border crossing include Unilateral bans on products, high fees by Agriculture and Food Authority-Kenya, trade information asymmetry, and single lane roads on the Kenya side that stifles cross-border business between Kenya and Uganda via Busia One-Stop Border Posts. There have also been traffic snarl-ups that have been blamed on poor road network and lack of power and internet connectivity at the border point.

The Busia border crossing is the main land checkpoint for goods and travellers passing between Kenya and Uganda. The facilities were upgraded in recent years to make it a one-stop border crossing between Busia, Kenya and Busia, Uganda. A vehicle and container scanner are one of the new installations that has hastened the processing time at Busia border points making a total of 500 trucks per day through all agencies. The town of Busia (Kenya) is the capital of Busia County and lies on the direct route between Kampala and Nairobi via Kisumu. Many travellers take a direct bus between the 2 capital cities, which takes 12-13 hours. Individuals crossing the Kenyan-Uganda border are required to have certain documents to do so, including the following: Passport (or national ID for East Africans). Visa (if applicable). Yellow fever vaccination certificate. Nationals of East African Community (EAC) member states do not need a visa to enter Kenya or Uganda and may also enter using a national ID card in place of their passport. International visitors who meet the Kenyan eVisa requirements can take the convenient option of applying for their visa online, which skips any unnecessary trips to an embassy. Some of the bottlenecks at the border crossing include Unilateral bans on products, high fees by Agriculture and Food Authority-Kenya, trade information asymmetry, and single lane roads on the Kenya side that stifles cross-border business between Kenya and Uganda via Busia One-Stop Border Posts.
